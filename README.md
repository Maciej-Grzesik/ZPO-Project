# Project Requirements

## Mandatory:

1. Processing numerical or textual data in the form of reading from a file or writing to a file in any structured format (JSON, XML, or equivalent).
2. Storing data in the form of objects using at least one of the mechanisms: inheritance, interface implementation.
3. Storing a collection of data in the form of a collection (list, set, or map).
4. Processing a collection of data using the stream mechanism with the use of at least one construction: lambda expressions, method references.
5. Implementation of exception handling using at least one custom exception type.
6. Implementation of unit tests.
7. Code documentation.

## Optional:

1. Application of the Optional class.
2. Application of the Enum data type.
3. Application of generic types.
4. Implementation of a user interface in the form of a command-line interface or a graphical interface.
